# INST126-Project-2
This program is a simple hangman game.
This program will prompt you to enter a letter or letters and the goal is to guess all the letters of the encrypted word within 10 guesses. If you do not input a letter or letters as your guess it will count towards an incorrect guess. You can either guess the word one letter at a time or you try to guess the entire word at any point. If you guess the word or all the letters correctly before your ten tries are up, you win. If you use all ten of your guesses, you lose.
